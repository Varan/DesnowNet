# PyTorch Implementation of DesnowNet

## Reproducability

In order to reproduce results, you must first obtain the Snow100K dataset, which can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/yunfuliu/desnownet), as well as the files attached to the project submission.

If you are using Google Colab, please uncomment the second and third cells of the Jupyter Notebook file; updating them with the root of the training and/or testing datasets.

Please update the `dirs` dictionary in the fourth cell with the locations of relevant files on your machine (The file `final_checkpoint.pt`, attached to the submission, contains the pretrained state of the model).

Finally, comment/uncomment the training and validation cells at the very bottom of the notebook depending on which you would like to run.

After this you can simply run all cells to reproduce results.

Thank you again for your time and consideration. Happy testing!
